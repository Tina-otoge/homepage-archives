# skiel.pro

This is my personal website.

It's both a presentation of myself and a demonstration of what kind of web designs I like to make.

The content doesn't reflect my professional profile or ambitions, nor it's a CV.
This is a an unprofessional page which serves as a first contact with Internet friends and other
developers when talking with me casually.
