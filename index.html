				<p class="content">
					I love Linux. It's so satisfying and convenient to use, I
					don't think I will ever be able to switch to Windows as my
					main OS ever.
				</p>
				<p>
					I use <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> with a
					minimal install on which I added <a href="https://i3wm.org">i3</a>.
					My configuration, alongside a bunch of softwares
					recommendations and tips can be found on <a href="https://github.com/skielred/Dotfiles">my Dotfiles repository</a>.

				<h2 class="title">beatmania IIDX</h2>
				<p class="content">
					If you ask me, IIDX is the best rhythm game, if not the
					best video game.
					It's simple yet efficient long-provem gameplay makes it a
					reference in the whole genre.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started investing myself in the game during fall 2015. I'm currently 8th dan in Single Play (7 keys) and 2nd dan in Double Play (14 keys).
