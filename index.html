				<h2 class="title">The name "Tina"</h2>
				<img src="img/tina_anime.png" alt="Tina Sprout from the anime of Black Bullet" class="lettrine round">
				<p>
					The name "Tina" actually comes from "Tina Sprout" from the
					light novel "Black Bullet". I owned an account named
					<i>tina_sprout</i> on some French forums years ago and got
					used to people calling me Tina.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since then, I decided to create my own original character
					called "Tina Sunglow". You can see her right above. Art
					was commissioned to <a href="https://twitter.com/Reiji_RJ/status/1088056718976827392?s=19">Reiji</a>.

				<p>
					I love Linux. It's so satisfying and convenient to use, I
					don't think I will ever be able to switch to Windows as my
					main OS ever.
				</p>
				<p>
					I use <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> with a
					minimal install on which I added <a href="https://i3wm.org">i3</a>.
					My configuration, alongside a bunch of softwares
					recommendations and tips can be found on <a href="https://github.com/skielred/Dotfiles">my Dotfiles repository</a>.

				<h2 class="title">beatmania IIDX</h2>
				<img src="img/iidx.png" alt="IIDX logo" class="lettrine">
				<p>
					If you ask me, IIDX is the best rhythm game, if not the
					best video game.
					Its simple yet efficient long-proven gameplay makes it a
					reference in the whole genre.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started investing myself in the game during fall 2015.
					I'm currently 8th dan in Single Play (7 keys) and 2nd dan in
					Double Play (14 keys).

				<p>
					Vim is the best editor there is, period. It's fun to use,
					it's powerful, it's blazing fast. There are no downsides to
					using Vim.

				<h2 class="title">The name "skielred"</h2>
				<img src="img/meklord_skiel.png" alt="The Yu-Gi-Oh! card Meklord Emperor Skiel" class="lettrine">
				<p>
					When I started playing arcade games, I wanted a new name. It
					had to be able to be shortened to something that sounds
					nice. skielred can actually be shortened to "SKL" when I can
					input only 3 letters (ie. Tetris), or SKIEL when I can use a
					bit more letters (ie. DJ SKIEL in IIDX).
				</p>
				<p>
					The name "skiel" actually comes from a Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's
					archetype, there is a card named "<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Meklord_Emperor_Skiel_(anime)">Meklord Emperor Skiel ∞</a>".
					When making rhythm games custom charts, I use "DJ SKIEL" as
					a nickname, the "DJ" part is a reference to beatmania IIDX.
					For special occasions, I sometimes used
					"UTOPIA MONARCH SKIEL" as a name when making charts, it
					references other Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.

				<h2 class="title">Rhythm games</h2>
				<p>
					I play rhythm games a lot, mostly arcade ones. Rhythm games
					are satisfying. They are kind of like a sport. The more you
					play them, the more you improve. And you aren't really
					rewarded for long and intensive play sessions. To improve at
					rhythm games, the best way is usually to play regularly,
					even if you don't play that much. It really feels like a
					sport.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have controllers at home to emulate the arcade feeling of
					various rhythm games such as beatmania IIDX, SOUND VOLTEX,
					Taiko no Tatsujin, pop'n music, Dance Dance Revolution,
					Groove Coaster, REFLEC BEAT, jubeat, BeatStream,
					CROSS×BEATS, I may be forgetting some lol. I play IIDX and
					voltex actively.

				<p>
					Compote is my girlfriend. She is a student in web design
					and watches anime. She also plays Azur Lane way too much.
					She is somehow good at Shadowverse.
				</p>
				<p>
					She has a Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/eymiimi">@Eymiimi</a>.
					You may or may not want to reach her
					on Discord at <span class="discord">Compote#3727</span>.

					She isn't actually called Compote.

				<h2 class="title">The name "Shookaite"</h2>
				<img src="img/chouquettes.jpeg" alt="Chouquettes, a French pastry" class="lettrine round">
				<p>
					Somewhen, in 2014, I think, together with some friends we
					created new nicknames to name our video game characters.
					They were all based on some dumb French wordplays. Shookaite
					is actually read the same way as "chouquette", a French
					pastry.

				<h2 class="title">I listen to music</h2>
				<p>
					Not surprising I guess. I listen mostly to hardcore
					electronic, I follow some Japanese music doujin circles.
					I like the works from Massive New Krew, USAO, RoughSketch.
					Actually I could name a lot of artists but the list would
					keep growing so please talk to me if you want to know more!

				<p>
					I play and collect Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. The game is fun. I went
					to some local tournaments and even tried the regional World
					Championship Qualifiers! I didn't do very well though lol.
					Building decks is fun, also collecting can be quite pleasant
					since some cards actually have very cool artworks.

				<h2 class="title">Anime and animation</h2>
				<p>I watch a lot of anime. I mostly watches what's currently
				airing. Every season I pick up from 6 to 12 shows, I usually
				have 2 or 3 episodes to watch everyday. It's relaxing to watch
				anime. I really enjoy admiring the art of animating things.</p>
				<p>
					I have <a href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Shookaite">on account on MyAnimeList</a>
					where you can see which shows I have watched on which ones
					I am currently watching. I don't update it after every
					episode, I usually update it at the start of each new
					season.
